    "Spacy-Stanza represents an advanced synergy of two prominent natural language processing (NLP) libraries, SpaCy and Stanza. SpaCy is known for its unparalleled speed, ease of use, and efficiency in natural language processing. In parallel, Stanza, formerly known as \"StanfordNLP\", is an NLP library developed by the renowned Stanford University, which provides sophisticated functions for the syntactic and semantic analysis of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergent implementation of spaCy and Stanza allows developers and researchers to exploit the full potential of both libraries. SpaCy provides an easy-to-use API for text processing, while Stanza offers advanced models and techniques for tokenization, part-of-speech (PoS) tagging, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER).\n",
    "\n",
    "A major advantage of SpaCy-Stanza is its language diversity, making it a highly versatile solution for NLP applications. The use of pre-trained models allows users to perform complex text analysis without having to train their own models from scratch. This makes it much easier to get started with NLP development and speeds up the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the basic functionalities, SpaCy-Stanza also offers extension options and customization features that allow for flexible configuration according to individual requirements. As a result, the integration of Stanza into spaCy has created a comprehensive NLP library that appeals to both novice and experienced developers and covers a wide range of natural language processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evaluation of 5000 selected data sets, SpaCy-Stanza achieved mixed results in terms of recognizing personally identifiable information (PII). Using Named Entity Recognition (NER), 20 different PII categories were recognized. However, there were problems with the automatic assignment of the different categories of SpaCy-Stanza to those present in the data set. A manual assignment was made for the evaluation in order to be able to evaluate the quality of the results in comparison with other models. Accuracy was the decisive factor in selecting the right model for the PII Detector application. With a maximum accuracy of 0.41 in the NAME category, the model is significantly behind the performance of other models, which are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, SpaCy-Stanza is a comprehensive and powerful NLP library that offers a harmonious blend of user-friendly interface and advanced linguistic analysis features. However, it is not suitable for the use case of the PII-Detector."
